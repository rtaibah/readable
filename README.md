# readable

A Reddit/HN clone built on React. No authentication or accounts. Built for the Udacity React course. Not sure what to do with it in the future. Might be fun to expand on it.

## Requirements

A [development backend server](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter) is needed to run the app. Make sure to install it.

## How to Install

	npm install
	
	npm start
